- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Anusha!
- I like building things, ideas, and concepts.
- I occasionally blog on Hashnode ![Image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hashnode-2962FF?style=for-the-badge&logo=hashnode&logoColor=white) if I have something interesting to share and something new that I am trying.
- I'd like my profile/projects to sort of be an exploratory journal where I try implementing with new things I've learnt. I'm here to learn, build my network, and collaborate.
- If you are an Open Source Enthusiast and are getting started, you should definitely join [EddieHub](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity)
