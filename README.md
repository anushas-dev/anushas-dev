👋 Hi, I’m Anusha!
- I like building things, ideas, and concepts.
- I occasionally blog on <a href="https://anushasridharan.in">Hashnode</a> if I have something interesting to share and something new that I am trying to build/explore. I'd like my space to be an exploratory journal where I try implementing new things I've learnt. 
- I'm here to learn, build my network, and collaborate.

<h3> Areas of Interest: </h3>
🔧 CI/CD Pipelines | ☁️ Cloud Platforms | 🐳 Containers & Orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes) | 🧪 Infrastructure as Code | 🔍 Monitoring & Observability | 🧠 Emerging Tech & Innovation

🚀 I’m particularly interested in collaborating on projects involving Python and Kubernetes. If you’re working on something exciting in this space, feel free to reach out!
